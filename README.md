# Graphs-in-Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
Assignment provided by ECGR 3180 (Data Structures and Algorithms in C++)

In this assignment you will implement the BFS and DFS graph traversal algorithms as a part of the code below (graph.cpp).

graph.cpp 

sample_edges.txt 

Here's the test - 

graph_test.cpp 

The code reads in a graph from the sample_edges.txt file (to be put in the same directory as your code), and returns an adjacency list. The adjacency list is a vector, where each element is in turn a vector of (adjacent vertex, edge weight) pairs. Typedef is used to enhance readability.

You are to use the adjacency list returned to implement the BFS and DFS algorithms. A header for the helper function is also included to implement DFS recursively.  A utility function that prints the queue is provided to help you with the BFS implementation.

Please do not modify any code provided including the test.

Upload your implementation of DFS and BFS in graph.cpp
